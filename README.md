# Split
Bipartisan News Viewer

In lieu of the divisive 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections, we decided to come up with a way to bridge the political gap, and to combat misinformation on the internet. Although there are many powerful fact-checking tools already available, not only are they computationally intensive, but going out of your way to check articles on their validity is tiresome and, to be frank, annoying.

Split aims to change all of that. Originally conceieved by Lenny Meng in SBUHacks 2020, Split aims to scrape news articles off the web and categorize them into a political spectrum of Democrat or Republican. To best understand those on either side of the poltical spectrum, Split will display articles on both sides of the page, to give everyone a peek into the other side.

# Tools and Technologies Used
For web scraping and categorization, we will use Python. For frontend, we are using Svelte. For the backend, we will use Express.JS. Everything will be powered by Node.JS. The database is hosted off off Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL. The frontend will also be hosted off of Amazon EC2.
